THBT it is in the interests of organized religions to adopt the "rigorous mission scheme" **Info Slide:** The Mormon church is one of the most active churches in terms of proselytizing its religion worldwide through missionary activity. Missions are usually performed by young men and women (recent school graduates, around 18-20 y.o.) who spend up to two years of their lives living and converting people in randomly assigned countries. Going on a mission is regarded as a virtue and Mormon children are socially conditioned to see it as one of the fundamental aspects of fulfilling their religious duties. Missions are mostly financed by missionaries themselves or sometimes partially financed by the church. For the purposes of this debate, this concept is described as a "rigorous mission scheme."
